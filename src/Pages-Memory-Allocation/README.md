<h1>Paging Memory Allocation Algorithm</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Paging is a memory allocation strategy used by operating systems.</li>
    <li>It allows the physical address space of a process to be non-contiguous.</li>
    <li>This is achieved by dividing the virtual address space of a process into fixed-sized units called pages.</li>
    <li>The physical memory is also divided into fixed-sized units called frames.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Algorithm Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>When a process needs to access a memory location, the operating system checks if the corresponding page is already loaded into memory.</li>
    <li>If the page is not in memory, it is loaded into a free frame.</li>
    <li>The operating system maintains a page table for each process that keeps track of which pages are currently in memory.</li>
    <li>When a page is loaded into memory, its frame number is stored in the page table.</li>
    <li>The operating system uses the page table to translate virtual addresses into physical addresses.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pseudocode</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Initialize page table and memory</li>
    <li>
        For each memory access request:
        <ol>
            <li>Calculate the page number and offset from the logical address</li>
            <li>Check if the page is already in memory using the page table</li>
            <li>If the page is not in memory, load it into a free frame</li>
            <li>Update the page table with the frame number</li>
            <li>Calculate the physical address using the frame number and offset</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Metrics & Characteristics</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Paging allows efficient use of physical memory by allowing non-contiguous allocation.</li>
    <li>It can reduce external fragmentation and improve memory utilization.</li>
    <li>However, it may introduce overhead due to the need for address translation and page table maintenance.</li>
