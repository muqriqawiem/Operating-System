<h1>Banker’s Algorithm</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Banker’s Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm.</li>
    <li>It is used by operating systems to ensure that system resources are allocated to processes in a safe manner.</li>
    <li>The algorithm operates by simulating the allocation of resources to processes and checking if the resulting state is safe.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Algorithm Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The algorithm takes as input the number of processes, the number of resources, the available resources, the maximum resources required by each process, and the currently allocated resources.</li>
    <li>It calculates the remaining resources needed by each process by subtracting the allocated resources from the maximum resources.</li>
    <li>The algorithm then checks if there is a process that can be safely executed, i.e., if its remaining resource needs can be satisfied by the available resources.</li>
    <li>If such a process is found, it is executed and its allocated resources are released and added to the available resources.</li>
    <li>The algorithm repeats this process until either all processes have been executed or no more processes can be safely executed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pseudocode</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Input data: number of processes, number of resources, available resources, maximum resources required by each process, currently allocated resources</li>
    <li>Calculate remaining resources needed by each process</li>
    <li>
        While not all processes have been executed:
        <ol>
            <li>Find a process that can be safely executed</li>
            <li>
                If such a process is found:
                <ol>
                    <li>Execute the process and release its allocated resources</li>
                    <li>Add released resources to available resources</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        If no process can be safely executed:
        <ol>
            <li>Deadlock detected</li>    
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Metrics & Characteristics</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Banker’s Algorithm can prevent deadlocks by ensuring that system resources are allocated in a safe manner.</li>
    <li>It can also detect deadlocks by identifying situations where no more processes can be safely executed.</li>
    <li>However, it may introduce overhead due to the need for maintaining resource allocation data and simulating resource allocation.</li>
