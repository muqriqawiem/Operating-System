<h1>FIFO Page Replacement Algorithm</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The FIFO page replacement algorithm is a memory management strategy used by operating systems.</li>
    <li>It operates by replacing the oldest page in memory when a page fault occurs.</li>
    <li>This is achieved by maintaining a queue of pages currently in memory.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Algorithm Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>When a page fault occurs, the algorithm checks if there is free space in memory.</li>
    <li>If there is free space, the new page is loaded into memory and added to the queue.</li>
    <li>If there is no free space, the oldest page in the queue is removed from memory and replaced with the new page.</li>
    <li>The new page is then added to the queue.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pseudocode</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Initialize a set to represent current pages in memory and a queue to store pages in FIFO manner</li>
    <li>
        For each page request:
        <ol>
            <li>
                If the set can hold more pages:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        If the page is not in the set:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Add the page to the set and increment page faults</li>
                            <li>Add the page to the queue</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <il>
        Else if the set is full:
        <ol>
            <li>
                If the page is not in the set:
                <ol>
                    <li>Remove the first page from the queue and from the set</li>
                    <li>Add the new page to the set and to the queue</li>
                    <li>Increment page faults</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Metrics and Characteristics</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The FIFO page replacement algorithm is simple to implement and understand.</li>
    <li>It can perform well when the number of page faults is low.</li>
    <li>However, it may perform poorly when the number of page faults is high, as it does not take into account the frequency of use of pages.</li>
</ul>
